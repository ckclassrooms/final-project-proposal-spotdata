### What does your application do?
The application should allow an user to connect to their Spotify account and then pull their selected playlists and favorite songs and in return get a map of people form cities which also have same interests in music as them based on the songs' artists. 

### What makes it different than a CRUD app? I.e., what functionality does it provide that is not just a user interface layer on top of a database of user information, and the ability to view / add to / change that information?
The application will be able to OAuth Spotify users and use the sporitfy API to access data from their accounts. Moreover, an additional API will be used to pull a map and vizualize 
the data. As of now likely a database will be used with predefined popularity of artists since Spotify is not exposing that API. 

### What security and privacy concerns do you expect you (as developers) or your users to have with this application?
It is likely that users may have concernes of their data/playlists or prviate information form their accounts shared/exposed.
